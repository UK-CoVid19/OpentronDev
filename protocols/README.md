## Opentron Protocols for CoVid-19

**Task1: Defining overall procedure/protocol for the testing process**
- communication needed with collaborators of qpcr design

**Task2: Protocol for each stage of the testing process**
- What is the exact protocol + code? What has to be done manually?
    - Stage 1: Sample Plating
    - Stage 2: RNA Extraction
    - Stage 3: qPCR Setup
